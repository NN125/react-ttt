# React TTT

## My Modifications

I added a new extension to the game that keeps track of the moves made in a round. All you have to do to is play the game like normal and you will see the number go up!

## Original Readme

Clone it into a directory that's not already a repo. `cd` into the new repo. `npm i` it. `npm run dev` it`. Optionally, try` npm t `to see the testing âœ…. Just remember that you would have to run` npm run dev `and` npm t` in separate terminal instances......
